Believe in yourself and all that you are
Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts
Challenges are what make life interesting and overcoming them is what makes life meaningful
Your time is limited, don't waste it living someone else's life
The harder you work for something, the greater you'll feel when you achieve it
Don't watch the clock; do what it does. Keep going.
Dream big and dare to fail
The only way to do great work is to love what you do
Your attitude determines your direction
Believe you can and you're halfway there
The future depends on what you do today
You are never too old to set another goal or to dream a new dream
The only thing standing between you and your goal is the story you keep telling yourself as to why you can't achieve it
You don't have to be great to start, but you have to start to be great
The only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today
If you want to achieve greatness, stop asking for permission
Success is walking from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm
Do what you love, and you'll never work another day in your life
The road to success and the road to failure are almost exactly the same
In the middle of every difficulty lies opportunity
The secret of getting ahead is getting started
What you get by achieving your goals is not as important as what you become by achieving your goals
Success usually comes to those who are too busy to be looking for it
Don't be pushed around by the fears in your mind. Be led by the dreams in your heart
The only person you are destined to become is the person you decide to be
